# ESP32S3-DEVKITC-Code-for-Wifi-USB-HOST-HTTP
In this repo, you would find multiple files related to the coding of ESP32 S3 DevKitC , you can use wifi, USB Host initialization and http request sending through this.

We are unsuccessful in sending the HTTP request to our backend server due to multiple clashes with wifi and USB host. There is a limitation from the esp32 side. If you want to persue this project 
it would be great to either use Raspberry Pi or similar board. 

Thank You
